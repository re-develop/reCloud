## F.A.Q. (Frequently asked Question)

#### Q: What does Clientless mean?
Clientless means that you don't get a Interface to interact with out of the box.

#### Q: Why don't you ship a Client with the API?
We want to focus on the API itself, we want to make sure the API is fast, secure and reliable - and as we are a rather small team, we want to focus on that. We'll make a basic Client and provide Wrappers for the API which can be used to make your own Client with ease.
